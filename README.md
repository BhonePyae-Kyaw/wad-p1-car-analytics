# Car Analytics

## Project Description

Car Analytics is a web application for market owners, offering detailed insights into various car models and brands. The platform features tables for model and brand comparisons, bar and pie charts for brand distribution, and car cards displaying essential details. Additionally, the highlight page allows users to view and manage their favorited cars.

## Features
**Dash Board**
- **Car Model Comparison:** Compare different car models based on various specifications such as engine performance, fuel efficiency, safety ratings, and more.
- **Interactive Visualizations:** Explore data through interactive charts and graphs that present car brand distribution in an easy-to-understand format.
- **Search Functionality:** Quickly find specific car models or brands using the powerful search feature.
- **Price Overview:** View and compare prices of various car models and brands in a clear and organized table.

**Car Cards**
- **Detailed Information:** Each car card displays essential details such as model, year, price, and location, giving market owners a quick overview of the cars available.
- **Favorite Feature:** Easily mark cars as favorites to keep track of them for future reference.

**Highlight Page**
- **Favorited Cars Display:** View all the cars youâ€™ve favorited in one place, organized similarly to the dashboard but without pagination.
- **Remove from Highlights:** Quickly remove cars from your favorites with a single click.
